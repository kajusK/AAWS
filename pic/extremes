wind
	average top ~15m/s (in Czech Republic) when ignoring huge storms
	cyclone 33 m/s
	tornado 100m/s

	let's consider 50 m/s as a maximum, I doubt the anemometer would survive
	half of that speed... and take anything slower than 0,1 m/s as zero

rain
	1 mm = 1 litre per one square meter
	The Czech republic average is 680mm (exceptions like Lysa hora 1390 mm)
	maximum was 204mm/7 hours

temperature
	minimum in CR -42°C, max 40,4°C
